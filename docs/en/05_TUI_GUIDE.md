# 05 TUI Guide: Use the Terminal Interface

This document is the single repo-level reference for the current DeepScientist TUI workflow.

For the current runtime control flow, prompt/skill execution model, MCP surface, and Canvas reconstruction logic, also see `docs/en/06_RUNTIME_AND_CANVAS.md`.

## Install And Start

Use the current workspace install:

```bash
pip install -e .
npm install
```

Common launcher commands:

```bash
ds
ds --tui
ds --both
ds --status
ds --stop
```

Notes:

- `ds` starts the managed daemon, prints the local web URL, tries to open the browser, and exits.
- `ds --tui` starts daemon plus the Ink-based terminal workspace.
- `ds --both` starts the daemon, opens the web workspace, and keeps the terminal workspace attached.
- `ds --stop` stops the managed daemon itself, not just one quest.
- `python -m deepscientist.cli ...` remains available for low-level commands, but the launcher is the normal path.
- from a source checkout, `node bin/ds.js` behaves the same as `ds`

## Core TUI Flow

Inside the TUI:

- `/home`: leave the current quest and return to request mode.
- `/projects`: open the quest browser.
- `/use <quest_id>`: bind the current TUI session to one quest.
- `/new`: create a quest from inside the TUI.
- `/new <goal>` creates the quest and auto-starts it through the daemon.
- `/delete <quest_id> --yes`: delete a quest (destructive; requires confirmation).
- plain text: send a normal user message to the bound quest.
- `/status`: inspect the current quest state.
- `/graph`: inspect the current quest graph.
- `/help`: show the in-TUI command list and control keys.
- `/config`: open the local config browser.
- `/pause`: pause the current quest; if no quest is bound, choose one in the panel.
- `/resume`: resume the current quest; if no quest is bound, choose one in the panel.
- `/stop`: stop the current quest; if no quest is bound, choose one in the panel.
- `/stop <quest_id>`: stop a specific quest explicitly.
- typing `/` in the input box shows a live command list; typing `/re`, `/co`, and similar prefixes filters the visible command rows
- in home mode, `↑/↓` and `Tab` only change the selected quest preview; they do not hard-switch an already bound quest
- in home mode, plain text does not create or send anything implicitly; use `/new <goal>` to create and `/projects` or `/use <quest_id>` to bind before chatting

If you are already inside a quest, `/pause`, `/resume`, and `/stop` target that quest automatically.

The footer and welcome banner also expose the main shortcuts directly:

- `Enter`: send or confirm
- `↑/↓`: browse selectors
- `Esc`: close the active overlay
- `Ctrl+O`: open the web workspace
- `Ctrl+C`: quit the TUI

## Message Delivery Model

The TUI, web UI, and connectors now share the same mailbox semantics.

1. The first plain user message for an idle quest starts a turn directly.
2. That first launch message is claimed by the run and does not get re-delivered later through the mailbox.
3. Later user messages that arrive while the agent is already running are written into `.ds/user_message_queue.json`.
4. Those queued messages are delivered only when the agent calls `artifact.interact(...)`.
5. When delivery happens, the agent receives the queued bundle as the latest user requirements and the queue entries move from `pending` to completed audit records.
6. If there is no new user message and the quest is still unfinished, the runtime can auto-start another turn so the agent keeps advancing from durable state instead of idling.
7. If there is no new user message, the runtime returns recent interaction records plus the instruction that the user did not send anything new.

Durable files used by this flow:

- `.ds/runtime_state.json`
- `.ds/user_message_queue.json`
- `.ds/interaction_journal.jsonl`
- `.ds/events.jsonl`

## Stop, Pause, Resume

Quest-level control:

- `/pause` interrupts the active runner and marks the quest as `paused`.
- `/resume` moves a `paused` or `stopped` quest back to `active`.
- `/stop` interrupts the active runner, clears `active_run_id`, and marks the quest as `stopped`.
- `/pause`, `/resume`, and `/stop` also append a visible assistant-side control notice into the quest chat history and push the same notice to bound connectors using the normal connector routing policy.

`/stop` semantics are intentionally stronger than `/pause`:

- queued but not yet delivered user mailbox messages are cancelled
- those cancelled messages are preserved in the queue audit trail with terminal status fields such as `cancelled_by_stop`
- the currently executing launch message is recorded as `accepted_by_run`
- the next user message after stop starts a fresh turn in the same quest context without silently replaying stale queued text
- stop does not rewrite Git state: the current branch, worktree, and already written files remain in place, so follow-up work resumes from the same repository context

Daemon-level stop:

- `ds --stop` shuts down the managed daemon
- it validates both `home` and `daemon_id` before touching the daemon
- it first asks the daemon to stop cleanly
- if needed it escalates to `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL`
- if shutdown succeeds, the launcher clears the daemon state file and prints `DeepScientist daemon stopped.`
- a clean daemon shutdown stops any actively running quests first, emits the same stop notice, and leaves Git/worktree state untouched for the next daemon start

## Artifact Interaction Expectations

The agent should use `artifact.interact(...)` as the long-lived conversation thread:

- `progress` and `milestone` updates are threaded, non-blocking status messages
- `decision_request` is the blocking form
- a blocking decision request should provide 1 to 3 concrete options, explain pros and cons, wait up to 1 day when feasible, then self-resolve and notify the user if the timeout expires
- true quest completion is separate from a normal decision request: the agent should first ask for explicit completion approval with `reply_schema.decision_type = quest_completion_approval`, and only then call `artifact.complete_quest(...)`

## Troubleshooting

If the TUI looks idle after you send text:

- confirm the quest is actually bound
- check the quest status with `/status`
- inspect `.ds/runtime_state.json` for `status`, `active_run_id`, and `pending_user_message_count`
- inspect `.ds/events.jsonl` for `runner.turn_error`, `quest.control`, or `artifact.recorded`

If a follow-up user message does not seem to reach the agent:

- check whether the quest is currently running
- inspect `.ds/user_message_queue.json`
- confirm the agent is calling `artifact.interact(...)` during long work

If stop appears ineffective:

- use `/stop` inside the quest first
- verify the quest becomes `stopped`
- for a full daemon shutdown use `ds --stop`
